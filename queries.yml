# File that defines endpoints for exposing Prometheus metrics for SQL result sets.
# It talks to a [SQL Agent](https://github.com/chop-dbhi/sql-agent) service that
# performs the query against the target database and returns the result set.
# The `driver`, `connection`, `sql`, and `params` options defined for each endpoint
# are passed to the service to execute the query. The other options are specific
# to this service.

# Name of the metric. Will be exposed as query_result_num_products
- num_records_temperature:
    # Name of the driver to use.
    driver: postgresql

    # Connection information.
    connection:
      host: postgres
      port: 5432
      user: postgres
      password: ""
      sslmode: disable
      database: postgres

    # SQL string. Parameters are name-based (not positional) and must be
    # prefixed with a colon. See `:category_id` in the query below for an example.
    # Must return single row, single column
    sql: >
        select count(*) from temperature

    # The time between query execution. This should be set relative to the frequency
    # of expected updates and the required granularity of changes.
    interval: 15s

    # value on error, default is null
    # if not null, when query has error, will use this value to indicate an error has occured
    #value-on-error: '-1'

- num_records_air:
    # Name of the driver to use.
    driver: postgresql

    # Connection information.
    connection:
      host: postgres
      port: 5432
      user: postgres
      password: ""
      sslmode: disable
      database: postgres

    # SQL string. Parameters are name-based (not positional) and must be
    # prefixed with a colon. See `:category_id` in the query below for an example.
    # Must return single row, single column
    sql: >
        select count(*) from air

    # The time between query execution. This should be set relative to the frequency
    # of expected updates and the required granularity of changes.
    interval: 15s

- num_records_dust:
    # Name of the driver to use.
    driver: postgresql

    # Connection information.
    connection:
      host: postgres
      port: 5432

        select count(*) from dust

    # The time between query execution. This should be set relative to the frequency
    # of expected updates and the required granularity of changes.
